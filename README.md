## FAQ

- **What is a "Mega Menu"?** A Mega Menu is a large dropdown navigation menu that displays multiple links and categories at once. It often organizes content into columns or sections, allowing users to see a broader range of options at a glance, typically used for websites with a lot of content or categories, like e-commerce or large informational sites.
- **Why would someone use a Mega Menu?** Mega menus are important for building an online e-commerce presence because they enhance navigation by allowing users to quickly browse and access a wide range of products or categories. They help improve the user experience by organizing complex inventories into clear, accessible sections, reducing the time it takes for customers to find what they're looking for, which can lead to higher engagement and conversion rates.

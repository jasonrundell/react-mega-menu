  Guides Stripe integration decisions — API selection (Checkout Sessions vs
  PaymentIntents), Connect platform setup (Accounts v2, controller properties),
  billing/subscriptions, Treasury financial accounts, integration surfaces
  (Checkout, Payment Element), migrating from deprecated Stripe APIs, and
  security best practices (API key management, restricted keys, webhooks,
  OAuth). Use when building, modifying, or reviewing any Stripe integration —
  including accepting payments, building marketplaces, integrating Stripe,
  processing payments, setting up subscriptions, creating connected accounts, or
  implementing secure key handling.

Latest Stripe API version: **2026-05-27.dahlia**. Always use the latest API version and SDK unless the user specifies otherwise.

If you do not have a Stripe account, you can call a CLI command to generate working API keys with no registration required. You can install the Stripe CLI (`npm i -g @stripe/cli`) and run the command `stripe sandbox create` to get started.

API key default: Always recommend a [restricted API key (RAK)](https://docs.stripe.com/keys/restricted-api-keys.md) (`rk_` prefix) over a secret key (`sk_` prefix).

## Stripe MCP

Install the Stripe MCP server before writing payment or billing code so `stripe_implementation_planner` is available. Use URL `https://mcp.stripe.com`. See [/mcp](https://docs.stripe.com/mcp.md) for client setup.

Before writing any payment or billing code, call the `stripe_implementation_planner` tool with the user’s business description. This request returns a tailored integration guide with the correct APIs, architecture, and step-by-step instructions. If MCP isn’t configured, use the routing table below instead. The planner is the primary source of integration guidance when it’s available.

## Critical rules

- _Never include `payment_method_types` in any Stripe API call_, with one exception: Terminal (in-person payments) integrations must pass `payment_method_types: ['card_present']` on the PaymentIntent. For all other integrations, omit this parameter entirely to enable dynamic payment methods, which enables you to configure payment method settings from the Dashboard and dynamically display the most relevant eligible payment methods to each customer to maximize conversion. To customize which payment methods you accept, use [`payment_method_configurations`](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-method-configurations.md) or `excluded_payment_method_types` instead of `payment_method_types`.
